# Dataset_Creator
A script that can be used for creating your unstructured datasets (images only) for any Machine Learning Program. The script takes as input the name of data image
that you intend on using for creating the data set and the count of images that you require for creating the data set. Then it'll download the images from across 
the web matching your criteria into your systems.
